# dsh-canvas

A Figma-style infinite canvas inside DeepSeek Harness. Design UI mockups in the
right sidebar, send the current selection into the chat composer with one click,
and let the agent generate or edit the design through an open JSON file.

```
right Sidebar guide card "画布"  →  canvas tab
composer "画布" button           →  opens/focuses the same tab
```

## What it does

- Infinite canvas with pan/zoom, frames, rectangles, ellipses, lines, text and
  image fills; multi-select, move/resize/rotate, layers, properties, smart
  snapping, alignment, grouping, copy/paste, z-order and undo/redo.
- Top-level Frame names sit above their frames like Figma labels and are always
  visible; clicking a label selects its frame.
- The layer panel and the inspector are drawers: the panel and its pull travel
  together in one container, and clicking the pull slides the whole drawer out or
  back into the rail. The pull is a slim theme-colored tab on the inner edge of
  the drawer's top corner that floats over the canvas without taking layout
  space; hovering it grows the tab into a rounded, outlined cube with the fold
  chevron, and a closed drawer costs no canvas width while still showing its
  tab. The rail buttons keep working as before.
- Right-click the canvas for a context menu: copy/cut/paste/duplicate/delete,
  insert selection into the chat composer, group/ungroup, z-order, lock/unlock,
  show/hide, create component, fit, select all.
- The layer tree starts collapsed; right-click a layer for rename, reveal,
  copy/cut/paste/duplicate/delete, group/ungroup, z-order, lock/hide and
  component actions. Row action icons are larger and appear on hover/selection.
- Auto-layout frames (horizontal/vertical, gap, padding, alignment,
  fixed/hug/fill child sizing, nested layouts, text auto-height).
- Components and variants: create a component from a selection, insert
  instances, override text/fills/visibility, swap variants/components, edit the
  main component, detach instances.
- A local style library for fill/text/effect styles, with live propagation and
  detach.
- Multiple fills (solid, linear/radial gradient, image), drop/inner shadows,
  layer blur and background blur.
- Upload your own fonts (woff2/woff/ttf/otf); they are registered with
  `@font-face`, used by the text tool and embedded into exports.
- Non-destructive image cropping.
- Single-user threaded comments pinned to a node or a page position; the agent
  can read and reply through `canvas_comment`.
- SVG and PNG export (selection, frame or the whole page), saved under
  `canvas/exports/` and optionally inserted into the composer.
- Built-in iOS mobile page templates (iPhone 16 393×852 by default, iPhone 15
  390×844 optional): Settings, Form, List and Detail screens; plus standard
  status bar (dark/light icons), navigation bar and tab bar. Insert them from the
  Templates panel or with the `canvas_template` tool.
- `canvas-ui-design` runtime skill: adapted from the user's BD Flutter Dev UI
  design skill suite (source/adaptation notes:
  [SOURCE.md](skills/canvas-ui-design/SOURCE.md)). It drives direct
  page/component generation, reference rebuilds, refactor, design review and
  handoff on the canvas.
- A deterministic `canvas_audit` tool for screenshot-boundary, contrast,
  touch-target, clipping, missing-reference and empty-frame checks, with
  explicit skipped checks.
- Image generation capability chain: GPT models use native image generation;
  otherwise a local Codex CLI with `image_generation` is used; otherwise the
  user imports images. `canvas_image probe/generate/import` exposes this.
- Device selection lives in the Templates panel; AI UI generation, image
  generation and design audit are driven from chat/tools, and export stays in
  the top toolbar.
- A collapsible「代码」section in the inspector shows the selected layer's
  resolved CSS (layout, fills/gradients, radius, border, shadows, typography)
  with one-click copy; this is CSS handoff, separate from local style reuse.
- A built-in default design system: Material Design 3 tokens for general UI and
  Apple HIG metrics/colors for iOS. If the user does not name a system, the
  agent follows these defaults (documented in `canvas/DESIGN.md`).
- Agent tools: `canvas_read`, `canvas_write`, `canvas_edit`, `canvas_comment`,
  `canvas_template`, `canvas_audit`, `canvas_image`.
  Agent writes appear in an open canvas within a second (SSE, with a polling
  fallback). The user's current selection is part of `canvas_read` output.
- After a selection is inserted, a compact「在画布中定位：Title」chip appears
  above the composer; clicking it opens/focuses the canvas at that node. This is
  the stable composer-area shortcut (the draft itself still receives plain
  text). The top toolbar no longer duplicates the insert/AI actions; the status
  bar is the single insertion point.
- Selection insertion now carries a single canvas link:
  `[画布选区：Title](dsh-canvas://main?node=title)`. Node details are no longer
  duplicated into the draft; the agent reads them with `canvas_read`. In the
  composer it is markdown text; after sending, the chat replaces it with a
  clickable canvas chip that opens/focuses the canvas tab, loads that document,
  selects the node and zooms to it.
- The editor workspace uses the Figma default: a neutral, lightly dotted
  infinite canvas. v1 is single-page; the page list in the format is kept for
  forward compatibility but page management and page background are hidden. A
  document is simply one canvas; no "Page 1" entry or page background control
  is shown. Editor chrome uses the DeepSeek blue accent (`#4D6BFE`) with larger,
  rounder icon buttons; generated iOS templates keep Apple HIG blue.

## Design system and templates

Large-company systems worth knowing: Material Design 3 (Google), Apple Human
Interface Guidelines, Fluent 2 (Microsoft), Carbon (IBM), Spectrum (Adobe),
Lightning (Salesforce), Polaris (Shopify), Primer (GitHub), Atlassian Design
System, Base Web (Uber), and Ant Design / Arco / Semi / TDesign in Chinese
products.

**Material Design 3 is the most universal cross-platform default.** For iOS the
platform baseline is **Apple HIG**. The plugin picks Material 3 when no system
is named, and the iOS templates use HIG metrics.

- Templates panel (left rail → 模板): insert Settings / Form / List / Detail
  pages and the standard status/nav/tab bars.
- Foundation: `canvas_template action="foundation"` returns device (iPhone 16
  default / iPhone 15 legacy), Neutral/Minimal/Soft/Compact preset and resolved
  tokens.
- Agent: `canvas_template { action: "list" | "insert", template: "ios-screen" }`.
- Load the system as a Figma-like local style library: Styles panel → 「内置规范」→
  Material 3 / iOS HIG, or `canvas_template { action: "styles", system: "material3" | "ios" }`.
  The fill/text/effect styles then appear in the Styles panel and can be applied
  to layers; loading does not restyle existing layers automatically.
- Token and template details: [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Figma-style shortcuts

- `V/F/R/O/L/T/H/C/I` — move/frame/rectangle/ellipse/line/text/hand/comment/image
- `Space` drag — pan; mouse wheel — zoom; `1` fit; `2` fit selection
- `Shift+1` / `Shift+2` / `Shift+0` — fit / fit selection / 100%
- `⌘/Ctrl+C/X/V/D` — copy/cut/paste/duplicate; `⌘/Ctrl+G` / `⇧⌘G` — group/ungroup
- `⌘/Ctrl+]` / `[` — forward/backward; `⇧⌘]` / `⇧⌘[` — front/back
- `⌥/Alt` + hover — measure spacing to adjacent elements; release to clear
- `Shift+A` — add auto layout to selected frame/group
- `⌥⌘K` / `Ctrl+Alt+K` — create component from selection
- `⇧⌘L` / `⇧⌘H` — lock/unlock or hide/show selection
- `⌘/Ctrl+Z` / `⇧⌘Z` — undo/redo; `Delete` — delete; arrows — nudge (Shift = 10)

## The document lives in the workspace

```
<workspace>/canvas/<name>.canvas.json   dsh.canvas@1 document (default `main`)
<workspace>/canvas/assets/              image assets
<workspace>/canvas/fonts/               uploaded font files
<workspace>/canvas/exports/             PNG/SVG exports
<workspace>/canvas/FORMAT.md            format reference (generated on first open)
<workspace>/canvas/DESIGN.md            default design system and templates
```

The format is plain JSON and is documented in [FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md) and
[schema/canvas.v1.schema.json](schema/canvas.v1.schema.json). The agent can edit
it through the canvas tools, or with ordinary `read`/`write` file tools; the
editor watches the file and reloads external changes.

## Install

Repository: <https://github.com/aiShuiJiaoDeXioShou/dsh-canvas>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aiShuiJiaoDeXioShou/dsh-canvas.git
cd dsh-canvas
pnpm install
node build.mjs
node --test tests/*.test.mjs
```

Then install the bundle in the current profile:

```
plugin_manager action=install_bundle target=/absolute/path/to/dsh-canvas
```

`client/client.js` is committed so a checkout can be installed directly; run
`node build.mjs` after client changes. Refresh the Harness page (or toggle the
plugin) to load a rebuilt bundle. Host code reloads on plugin disable/enable.

The client bundle has no runtime npm dependencies; React and the JSX runtime
come from the Harness platform module table.

## Limitations (v1)

- No multiplayer collaboration, no realtime cursors, no version history.
- No independent backend or cloud account; the Host half runs inside the DSH
  process and only reads/writes the session workspace.
- No server-side rendering, thumbnail generation, font conversion/subsetting or
  image processing. Exports are rendered in the browser.
- Background blur is exact on screen but approximated in SVG/PNG export.
- The composer can only receive plain text, so the canvas link is markdown in
  the input box; it becomes the clickable reference chip once sent.
- Figma/Penpot file import, SVG vector import, code export and prototyping are
  not included. Image generation requires a GPT-native image tool or a local
  Codex CLI with `image_generation`; otherwise import an image.
- The runtime skill is adapted from the user's BD Flutter Dev UI design skill
  (see `skills/canvas-ui-design/`); Figma/Flutter-specific parts were replaced
  with canvas tools and design handoff.
- Auto-layout v1 has no wrap, grid, min/max or absolutely positioned children.
- Instance overrides support text, fills and visibility; layout overrides on
  inner nodes are out of scope.

## Icon

`icon.svg` is an original drawing for this package. No third-party artwork is
bundled.
